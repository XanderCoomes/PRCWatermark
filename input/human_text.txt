On March 15, 44 BCE—the Ides of March—Julius Caesar walked into a meeting of the Senate at the Theatre of Pompey believing he would hear petitions and conduct routine business. He was, by then, Rome’s most powerful man: conqueror of Gaul, victor in civil war, and recently named dictator perpetuo (dictator for life). To many senators, especially a group led by Gaius Cassius Longinus and Marcus Junius Brutus, that title signaled an end to the republic’s delicate balance of power. They convinced themselves that a single, violent act could restore liberty.

The plan was choreographed. As Caesar took his seat, the senator Tillius Cimber approached with a plea to recall his exiled brother. When Caesar waved him off, conspirators crowded closer under the pretense of supporting the petition. Cimber tugged Caesar’s toga—both signal and restraint—and Publius Servilius Casca struck first. Knives flashed from beneath tunics. Caesar tried to defend himself before collapsing under more than twenty wounds. Whether he spoke the famous “Et tu, Brute?” is Shakespeare’s invention; ancient sources record only a cry in Greek, disputed even then.

The assassins expected acclaim. Instead, they met silence and fear. Their promise to revive republican norms lacked a plan to command legions, feed the city, or calm a population that had benefited from Caesar’s reforms. Marcus Antonius (Mark Antony) seized the political moment with a carefully staged funeral that displayed Caesar’s bloodstained garments and inflamed the crowd. Within months, Caesar’s heir Octavian joined Antony to defeat the “Liberators” at Philippi. The ensuing power struggles ended not in restored senatorial rule but in the Principate of Augustus—an autocracy with republican ornament.

Caesar’s murder is therefore a paradox: an act committed in the name of liberty that hastened liberty’s eclipse. It shows how political violence, even when aimed at a single man, can destabilize institutions and invite outcomes more sweeping—and more durable—than its architects imagined.
