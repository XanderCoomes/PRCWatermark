 AI in education is a rapidly advancing field that holds significant potential to transform how learners access knowledge, interact with content, personalize their learning experience, and receive support throughout their educational journey.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems capable of performing tasks typically requiring human intelligence such as understanding language, recognising patterns, making decisions or solving problems. When applied within educational settings, AI technologies can automate routine administrative functions like grading assignments, sending reminders for upcoming deadlines, tracking student progress over time, identifying at-risk students based on behavior, attendance, grades, or engagement metrics â€” allowing educators more time to focus on teaching rather than bureaucratic duties.

One of the most promising applications of AI is personalized instruction. Traditional classrooms often follow a one-size-fits-all approach where all students learn material at similar paces regardless of individual differences in ability levels, interests, or learning styles. However, AI-powered platforms leverage data analytics and machine-learning algorithms to assess each learner's strengths and weaknesses in real-time; subsequently recommending customized lessons, exercises, and resources tailored specifically to them. This personalization fosters deeper comprehension by enabling learners to move through materials at speeds that match their cognitive rhythms while filling gaps identified during active assessment processes.

Additionally, natural language processing capabilities have revolutionized ways students engage with digital texts
