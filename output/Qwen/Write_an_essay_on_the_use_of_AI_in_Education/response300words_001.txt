Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming various sectors, including education—a domain that has long been rooted in tradition yet remains deeply responsive to innovation. The integration of artificial intelligence into educational systems promises not only enhanced learning outcomes but also greater personalization, accessibility, efficiency, and equity for learners across diverse backgrounds. As classrooms worldwide grapple with challenges such as student engagement, teacher workload, resource disparities, and individual differences in cognitive development, AI emerges as a powerful tool capable of addressing these issues through data-driven insights and adaptive technologies.

One of the most transformative applications of AI within education is personalized instruction. Every learner possesses unique strengths, weaknesses, interests, and paces of understanding. Traditional classroom models often adopt one-size-fits-all curricula, which may leave some students behind or fail to engage those who learn differently. AI-powered platforms can analyze vast amounts of behavioral and performance data—such as quiz responses, time spent on tasks, interaction patterns, and even facial expressions—to create dynamic learning pathways tailored to each student's needs. For instance, intelligent tutoring systems like Carnegie Learning’s math software adapt questions based on real-time feedback, offering explanations when concepts are misunderstood and
