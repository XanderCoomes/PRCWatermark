Introduction  
The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into educational systems represents a transformative shift, reshaping how knowledge is delivered, accessed, and learned. From personalized learning pathways to automated assessments and intelligent tutoring, AI technologies have begun to redefine traditional pedagogical practices. As digital infrastructure continues to expand globally, particularly during periods such as the pandemic-induced remote learning crisis, AI has emerged not just as a supplement but as a core component of modern education strategies. This essay explores key applications of artificial intelligence in education—its benefits for learners, educators, and institutions—and addresses ongoing challenges related to equity, privacy, and ethical considerations.
