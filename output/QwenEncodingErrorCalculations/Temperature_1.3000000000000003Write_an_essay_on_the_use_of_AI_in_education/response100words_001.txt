When discussing the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) within educational settings, it is essential to recognize both its transformative potential and the complex challenges that accompany such integration.

Artificial Intelligence offers a range of tools designed specifically for improving teaching practices and learning outcomes across various age groups and subject areas. One primary application lies in personalizing instruction â€” by analyzing data from student performance over time, including assessments, participation patterns, assignments submitted, etc., AI systems can adapt lesson plans or provide targeted interventions based upon individual needs. For example, adaptive learning platforms like Khan Academy use machine-learning algorithms to deliver customized content paths tailored to each learner's pace, strengths,
