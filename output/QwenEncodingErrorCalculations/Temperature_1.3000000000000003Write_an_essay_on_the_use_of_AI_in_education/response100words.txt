From personalized learning pathways to automated grading systems, AI is reshaping how knowledge is delivered, accessed, and assessed. As educators, policymakers, and learners grapple with its implications, it becomes imperative not only to understand technological capabilities but also to approach their integration with mindfulnessâ€”acknowledging ethical considerations, pedagogical integrity, and human values.

At its core, artificial intelligence offers transformative potential for individualized instruction.
