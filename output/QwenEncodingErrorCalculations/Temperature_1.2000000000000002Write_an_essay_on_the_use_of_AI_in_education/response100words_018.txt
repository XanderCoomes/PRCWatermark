 *Title: The Transformative Role of Artificial Intelligence in Education*

Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly evolved from a theoretical concept into a transformative force across numerous sectors, with one of its most promising domains being education. As learning demands become more personalized, diverse, and globally connected, traditional educational models face significant challengesâ€”inequity, inefficiency, scalability issues, and a lack of individualized instruction. In response to these obstacles, artificial intelligence is emerging as a pivotal tool that enhances access, personalization, efficiency, and equity within the educational ecosystem.

One of the most profound impacts of AI on education lies in adaptive learning systems.
