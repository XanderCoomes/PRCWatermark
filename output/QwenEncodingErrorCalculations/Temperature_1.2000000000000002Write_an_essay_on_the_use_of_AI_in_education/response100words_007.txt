The Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Education: A Transformative Paradigm Shift

In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI)—the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines—has emerged as a transformative force across numerous industries. Among these sectors, education stands out as one where AI holds significant promise to reshape teaching methodologies, enhance learning outcomes, personalize instruction, and democratize access to quality knowledge. As global educational systems grapple with challenges such as unequal resource distribution, rising student populations, teacher shortages, and diverse learner needs, AI presents both opportunities and responsibilities that demand careful consideration from educators, policymakers, technologists, and parents alike.
