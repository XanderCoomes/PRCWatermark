The integration of artificial intelligence into education is transforming traditional learning models and redefining how knowledge is delivered and accessed  
Artificial intelligence offers personalized learning pathways that adapt to individual students' needs based on their performance data and pace of understanding  
One major benefit of AI-powered tools is their ability to provide instant feedback, allowing learners to correct mistakes immediately rather than waiting for teacher assessments  
Intelligent tutoring systems simulate human guidance by recognizing patterns in student behavior and offering targeted questions or explanations when necessary  
AI also enables scalable assessment solutions where machine grading handles large volumes of responses
