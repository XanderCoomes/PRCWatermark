Title: The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Advancing Adult Literacy Development in Nepal

In recent years, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have opened transformative pathways across numerous sectors—healthcare, transportation, agriculture, finance—and increasingly so in education. Among its many applications, AI shows immense promise for enhancing learning outcomes by personalizing instruction, providing scalable support systems, and reducing accessibility barriers to quality education globally. This paper examines how AI can be leveraged specifically within adult literacy programs in Nepal—a country where adult illiteracy remains a persistent socioeconomic challenge despite ongoing policy efforts toward inclusive education reform.
